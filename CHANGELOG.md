## [0.38.1] - 2026-07-09

### Security

- **Dependabot remediation sweep ([epic #526](https://github.com/amiable-dev/llm-council/issues/526))** — closed all 72 open Dependabot alerts (2 critical, 21 high, 28 medium, 21 low) across 19 packages, all resolved via `uv.lock` package bumps (no application code changes):
  - `litellm` 1.80.11 → 1.91.1 ([#527](https://github.com/amiable-dev/llm-council/issues/527)) — 2 critical + 6 high, including an auth-bypass-via-Host-header-injection CVE. Optional `[ollama]`-extra dependency only.
  - `starlette` 0.50.0 → 1.3.1, `python-multipart`, `cryptography`, `urllib3`, `pyjwt`, `vcrpy`, `mcp` ([#528](https://github.com/amiable-dev/llm-council/issues/528)) — 27 high-severity-bearing alerts across the HTTP/MCP request stack. Also bumps `fastapi` 0.123.0 → 0.139.0 (not itself flagged; required transitively to unblock the starlette fix version).
  - `aiohttp` 3.13.2 → 3.14.1 ([#529](https://github.com/amiable-dev/llm-council/issues/529)) — 29 alerts, the single largest package in the sweep.
  - `pydantic-settings`, `pymdown-extensions`, `idna`, `python-dotenv`, `pytest`, `requests`, `filelock`, `pygments` ([#530](https://github.com/amiable-dev/llm-council/issues/530)) — 8 remaining medium/low alerts.
  - Verified via [#531](https://github.com/amiable-dev/llm-council/issues/531): zero open Dependabot alerts remain, no new alerts introduced by the resolution changes, full test suite green throughout.
  - Also fixed in passing: `verify()`/`council-gate` silently excluded `uv.lock` from review (`.lock` missing from `TEXT_EXTENSIONS`) — tracked separately as [#533](https://github.com/amiable-dev/llm-council/issues/533).

## [0.38.0] - 2026-07-09

**Gateway routing + optional chairman bypass ([#519](https://github.com/amiable-dev/llm-council/pull/519), external contribution from [@pczerkas](https://github.com/pczerkas)).**

### Added

- **Gateway-aware endpoint resolution for council queries** — council model queries now honor `gateways.default` and `gateways.providers.<name>.base_url`/`.api_key` instead of always hitting OpenRouter, via a new `llm_council.gateway.resolver` module. Adds a per-gateway `gateways.model_name_map` config field so a single tier pool can serve gateways with different model-id conventions (e.g. Requesty rejects OpenRouter's `:free` suffix). OpenRouter remains the default/fallback; existing configs are unaffected. Note: this resolves routing on the code path that's actually live today (`gateway_adapter.py`'s direct-call fallback) rather than the ADR-023 `GatewayRouter`/`RequestyGateway` class abstraction, which is currently unreachable via config — see [#524](https://github.com/amiable-dev/llm-council/issues/524).
- **`chairman_disabled` council option** — `chairman_disabled: true` (or `LLM_COUNCIL_CHAIRMAN_DISABLED=true`) skips Stage 3 chairman synthesis and returns the top-ranked Stage 1 response directly, for workflows where a chairman-synthesized answer isn't required. **Never enable this for BINARY-verdict use** (`council-verify`/`council-gate`, CI approval gates) — no verdict is computed; the verify API reports `verdict: "unclear"`, `unclear_reason: "chairman_disabled"` instead of a fabricated pass/fail. See [Verification guide](docs/guides/verify.md#reading-an-unclear-verdict-adr-047).

### Fixed

- **`chairman_disabled` no longer corrupts BINARY verdicts** — pre-merge review caught that `build_verification_result()` was falling through to the legacy regex verdict-extractor on a `chairman_disabled` response, scraping a raw Stage-1 peer answer (never intended as a verdict) for approval/rejection language. Now short-circuits to an explicit `verdict: "unclear"` / `diagnostics.verdict_source: "chairman_disabled"` instead of a possible fabricated pass/fail.
- **README documented a nonexistent `LLM_COUNCIL_USE_GATEWAY` env var** under "Enable the gateway layer" — the variable is never read anywhere in `src/`, so following that instruction silently did nothing. Replaced with a pointer to the config that actually routes live traffic (`gateways.default` / `gateways.providers.*`).

## [0.37.1] - 2026-07-05

### Fixed

- **Release housekeeping** — the `v0.37.0` git tag was cut one commit early and did not include the `chore(release): Prepare v0.37.0 release` commit (the CHANGELOG `[0.37.0]` heading + the ADR-051 Status → Implemented flip). The published `0.37.0` wheel was functionally complete (all ADR-051 C4–C6 code was already on `master`); this patch re-tags so the release commit is included in the tagged history. **No functional or API change from `0.37.0`.**

## [0.37.0] - 2026-07-05

**Verify Findings Channel — telemetry, diagnostics & docs (ADR-051, C4–C6 of epic [#484](https://github.com/amiable-dev/llm-council/issues/484))** — completes the epic on top of the v0.36.0 mechanical gate. Still behind `LLM_COUNCIL_STRUCTURED_FINDINGS` (**default OFF; flag-off byte-identical**); the whole epic remains non-breaking and the default-ON flip is a separate later release.

### Added

- **Docs sweep + response-field drift guard (ADR-051 C6, #490)** — the full `verify` response contract (`VerifyResponse` + nested `Finding`/`VerifyDiagnostics`) is documented field-by-field in `docs/guides/verify.md`, with a consumer migration note (**stop keying on `blocking_issues == []`; key on `verdict` + `findings`/`severity`**) propagated to the MCP guide, the CI/CD blog, and the bundled `council-verify`/`council-gate` skills. New `TestVerifyResponseFieldDrift` guard in `tests/test_docs_drift.py` fails CI on any undocumented response field.
- **Consistency-invariant + severity telemetry (ADR-051 C4, #488)** — `diagnostics.findings_by_severity` (per-severity counts, surfacing severity mis-labelling) and a defensive `diagnostics.verdict_evidence_mismatch` marker that asserts the mechanical-gate invariant (a `fail` iff a `critical` finding exists) and logs if it is ever violated.
- **Inner-verdict diagnostics (ADR-051 C5, #489)** — `diagnostics.inner_verdict`/`inner_confidence`/`inner_confidence_calibrated` capture the structured verdict **before** the low-confidence UNCLEAR softening (nested under `diagnostics` so consumers can't parse them to bypass the gate). The mechanical block recomputes agreement-confidence for its verdict and applies all result mutations atomically (calibrated once, throw-free apply) so a mid-computation error leaves the legacy result intact.

## [0.36.0] - 2026-07-05

**Verify Findings Channel — structural fix, opt-in (ADR-051, C1–C3 of epic [#484](https://github.com/amiable-dev/llm-council/issues/484))** — fixes the field-reported defect where `verify()`'s `blocking_issues` was `[]` on nearly every call (the verdict came from a structured path while `blocking_issues` was regex-scraped from chairman prose modern models don't format with `SEVERITY:` markers). Behind the new `LLM_COUNCIL_STRUCTURED_FINDINGS` flag (**default OFF — additive, non-breaking; flag-off is byte-identical**) the chairman now emits a structured `findings[]` array and the verdict is **computed from it by host code** (the "mechanical gate": any `critical` finding ⇒ `fail`), so the verdict can't decouple from the evidence and `blocking_issues` = the critical subset. This is the core of ADR-051; the consistency-invariant telemetry (C4), inner-verdict diagnostics (C5), docs sweep (C6), and the eventual default-ON flip (a separate breaking release) follow. Two Council reviews + an enforcement-fork review shaped the mechanical-gate design; the findings parser itself was hardened across ~10 Council rounds (string-aware JSON extraction, fail-safe severity normalization, no-drop findings).

### Added

- **Mechanical verdict + derived `blocking_issues` (ADR-051 C3, #487)** — `findings.verdict_policy()` computes the verdict as a pure function of the findings (any `critical` ⇒ `fail`); `blocking_issues` is the critical subset. Severity is normalized **fail-safe** (a missing/unrecognized/typo'd severity ⇒ `critical`, never a silent false-pass); the confidence→`unclear` softening is unchanged. Flag-off and the parse-fallback path keep the legacy prose behavior (the #355 non-fabrication guard is preserved).
- **Structured findings emission (ADR-051 C2, #486)** — the chairman's BINARY-verdict JSON gains a findings-first `findings[]` array; `findings.parse_findings()` extracts it with an LLM-resilient, string-aware balanced-brace JSON scanner and soft-fails to the legacy path (`findings_source`/`fallback_reason` recorded).
- **Findings/diagnostics schema + flag (ADR-051 C1, #485)** — `Finding` and `VerifyDiagnostics` models, additive `VerifyResponse.findings`/`.diagnostics` (empty defaults), and the `LLM_COUNCIL_STRUCTURED_FINDINGS` opt-in flag (default off). `blocking_issues` type unchanged (`List[BlockingIssueResponse]`).

## [0.35.0] - 2026-07-04

**PostHog LLM Analytics Emission (ADR-050)** — epic [#472](https://github.com/amiable-dev/llm-council/issues/472). Verify telemetry stops being local-only: an **opt-in, off-by-default** emitter sends one `$ai_generation` event per council-member model to PostHog, so cost trends, the ADR-049 cache-hit-rate guard, and Council calibration land in a dashboard instead of a grep. Every external claim was verified against primary PostHog docs (adversarial deep-research, 92 agents) plus empirical checks of the live receiving project, then Council-reviewed; the feature-flag tier-routing slice (ADR-050 Part 4) was deferred to its own ADR as a critical-path concern.

### Added

- **Adjudication `$ai_metric` contract (ADR-050 D4, #476)** — `observability/adjudication.py` `emit_adjudication(verification_id, disposition, …)` posts a human disposition (`real`/`marginal`/`refuted`/`pass-clean`) onto a verify trace by emitting a follow-up `$ai_metric` keyed to the same `$ai_trace_id = verification_id`, with a numeric `metric_value` (for TPR/FPR trends) plus a text `adjudication_label`. The cross-repo hook for epic-loop's retro — not PostHog's automated Evaluations product (refuted as a retroactive-score sink). Required-input validation is strict; emission is soft-fail + opt-in.
- **Content-free privacy + residual-leakage rules (ADR-050 D3, #475)** — the property mapper is an allowlist, not a passthrough: `$ai_input`/`$ai_output_choices` are never emitted (council prompts carry customer code); `scrub_exception` logs the exception type only so a provider error echoing the prompt can't leak; `subject_sha` stays an opaque digest.
- **`$ai_generation` emission per member call (ADR-050 D2, #474)** — maps the ADR-011 `usage.by_model` summary to one `$ai_generation` per member, keyed to `$ai_trace_id = verification_id`. `$ai_input_tokens` is clamped to the non-cached count (`max(0, prompt − cache_read)`) so PostHog's hit-rate tile isn't double-counted; `$ai_total_cost_usd` carries our ADR-011 ground truth (overriding PostHog's auto-calc) only when `cost_known`. Wired into the verify result path, gated before import so it's byte-identical when disabled.
- **PostHog emitter foundation (ADR-050 D1, #473)** — opt-in, off-by-default emitter (`observability/posthog_emitter.py`): `POSTHOG_API_KEY` + `POSTHOG_HOST` (default EU ingestion host `eu.i.posthog.com`), an import-guarded lazy client (the optional `posthog` SDK is never imported when unconfigured), a non-blocking batched soft-fail `emit()`, and a bounded idempotent `shutdown()` (daemon-thread flush joined with a timeout so a stuck flush can't hang the process). New `[posthog]` extra.

## [0.34.0] - 2026-07-04

**Prompt Caching Across Gateways (ADR-049)** — epic [#458](https://github.com/amiable-dev/llm-council/issues/458). Verification rounds re-send a nearly identical prompt every round; this release makes the stable prefix actually cacheable and the cache observable. Stable-prefix-first prompt assembly (D1), Anthropic `cache_control` breakpoints + OpenRouter session affinity on the verify path (D2, default ON — price-class-only, empirically verified −92% read cost on the production route), cache price classes in registry estimates (D3), cache-write/route/session telemetry with log-only hit-rate reconstruction (D4), and a per-path TTL knob with an opt-in live probe (D5). Every decision traces to the ADR's research matrix — vendor docs adversarially verified plus two-call probes on our own key; refuted routes (OpenAI/Gemini/DeepSeek via OpenRouter) are documented with a quarterly re-probe note.

### Added

- **Prompt-cache TTL knob + live probe (ADR-049 D5, #463)** — `LLM_COUNCIL_PROMPT_CACHE_TTL` (`5m` | `1h`) overrides the per-path TTL rendered into the Anthropic `cache_control` directive; the verify path defaults to `1h` (verification rounds arrive 3–11 minutes apart — a lapsed 5-minute cache pays the write premium every round), interactive paths to `5m`; invalid values fall back to the path default. Named distinctly from the pre-existing `LLM_COUNCIL_CACHE_TTL` (response cache, seconds). Adds the opt-in live two-call cache probe test (`LLM_COUNCIL_LIVE_CACHE_PROBE=true`, ~$0.05 real spend, never in CI) asserting second-call cache reads > 0 and a discounted `usage.cost`, with the quarterly re-probe note for the refuted OpenAI/Gemini/DeepSeek-via-OpenRouter matrix rows.
- **Cache-write + route/session telemetry (ADR-049 D4, #462)** — cache-WRITE tokens are now captured per call (Anthropic direct `cache_creation_input_tokens` / per-TTL sub-object; OpenRouter `prompt_tokens_details.cache_write_tokens`) and aggregated through the ADR-011 usage block (per stage / model / total) into verify `input_metrics.cache_write_tokens`; each call records its serving `route` and `session_id`, and `input_metrics.cache_session_id` groups verification rounds so the prompt-cache hit rate per subject is reconstructable from `.council/logs` alone. A missing provider field degrades to 0 (full-price accounting) — never a crash or a fabricated figure.
- **Cache price classes in cost estimation (ADR-049 D3, #461)** — `registry.yaml` pricing entries gain optional `cache_read` / `cache_write_5m` / `cache_write_1h` per-1K price classes (populated for Anthropic models at the verified 0.1× / 1.25× / 2× prompt-price multipliers), and `CostResolver.resolve` prices the provider's separate cache token fields on the registry-estimate path. An entry without a cache class bills those tokens at the prompt price (documented default), and the provider-cost path (OpenRouter/Requesty `usage.cost`) is untouched — ground truth already includes the cache discount and wins unconditionally.
- **Prompt-cache injection + session affinity (ADR-049 D2, #460)** — the verify path now publishes its D1 segment map into a request-scoped `CacheContext` (ContextVar, zero signature changes); `build_openrouter_payload` consumes it to place Anthropic `cache_control` breakpoints (ephemeral, 1h TTL, at the evidence and subject boundaries — empirically verified −92% read / 1.25× write pass-through on the OpenRouter route) and an OpenRouter `session_id` affinity key (`verify:{subject-digest}`, stable across rounds, never per-SHA). Safety rails: per-model minimum-prefix guards (Fable 5: 512 / Opus 4.8 & Sonnet 5: 1,024 / Haiku 4.5 and unknown: 4,096 tokens), injection only when the outgoing prompt matches the published segment map (stage-2/3 prompts are a no-op), ≤2 of Anthropic's 4 breakpoints used, byte-identical reassembly test-pinned. `LLM_COUNCIL_PROMPT_CACHING=false` kill-switch restores byte-identical payloads (default ON — price-class-only change). The OpenRouter gateway declares a `CachingCapability` descriptor (`explicit` / `anthropic_cache_control` / billing pass-through verified).

### Changed

- **Stable-prefix-first prompt assembly (ADR-049 D1, #459)** — the verification prompt is restructured into stability-ordered segments: static head (role/instructions/rubric/focus) → evidence (ADR-042) → subject (file contents) → volatile tail. The snapshot SHA — previously the FIRST line, invalidating any provider prompt cache from byte zero on every round — now lives only in the tail. Segment boundaries (char offsets + token estimates) are exposed on the prompt-builder's render info for ADR-049 D2 cache-breakpoint placement. Byte-stability is golden-file-tested: two rounds of the same subject with different SHAs are byte-identical through the evidence segment. Intentional prompt drift: the ADR-042 evidence_none golden hash is regenerated (ordering contract — focus → evidence → code — preserved and test-pinned).

## [0.33.0] - 2026-07-03

**Documentation Usability Overhaul** — epic [#443](https://github.com/amiable-dev/llm-council/issues/443), from the 2026-07-03 documentation review. Ships the documented-but-missing API surfaces (docs-as-spec: the `consult_council` Python facade and `gate --tier`), fixes every doc that failed when executed, surfaces the v0.25–v0.32 feature set on the published site (which had frozen at ADR-038), and adds CI drift guards so docs currency is enforced like code currency.

### Added

- **Docs small-fixes batch + DoD process fix (#449)** — clean `llm_council.yaml.example` template (the root `llm_council.yaml` is the project's own dev config and was headered v0.15.0); `examples/eval_bridges/README.md` with prereqs + spend warning; the HTTP API now reports the real package version in Swagger (was hardcoded 1.0.0) with proper OpenAPI description/tags; METHODOLOGY↔GOVERNANCE cross-links + the full bench workflow in METHODOLOGY; bench/calibration `--help` text now shows the spend caps; epic DoD guidance updated to include the published docs site (the process hole that froze it at ADR-038).
- **Canonical env reference + CI docs-drift guards (#448)** — `docs/reference/environment-variables.md` documents all 95 environment variables the code actually reads (grouped by subsystem), and `tests/test_docs_drift.py` makes divergence a test failure: env reads missing from the reference, phantom documented vars (the #446 failure class — which immediately caught #446's own over-deletion of the real `FAST_PATH_*`/`ROLLBACK_*`/`SHADOW_*` vars), README phantom mentions, ADRs unreachable from the mkdocs nav, and guide snippets that fail to parse/import. Docs currency is now enforced like code currency (server-card/bench drift-test pattern).
- **Docs-site refresh — v0.25–v0.32 functionality surfaced (#447)** — mkdocs nav gains ADRs 039–048, the 2026-H2 roadmap (all five items now marked shipped), and the ADR-045 stateless audit; three NEW guides: Verification & CI Gating (tiers, `unclear_reason` routing, calibration, screening, evidence), Streaming (SSE event/envelope reference, token streaming, MCP progress), and Quality Benchmark (drift regression, quality-per-dollar, spend caps) with a nav home for the harness-published results page; the MCP guide documents all four tools (verify/audit were absent); landing-page features updated past 2025.
- **Critical documentation accuracy fixes (#446)** — the published quickstart and Python guide now use APIs that exist (the #444 facade; `run_full_council` examples corrected to its real list/dict shapes with ADR-011 cost access); `docs/api.md` installs the right package and documents the streaming, server-card, and Jury-Mode surfaces; the README install flow leads with `[mcp,secure]` + the silent-keychain warning + the `uv tool` path; MCP client-timeout guidance (MCP_TIMEOUT) added to README and the MCP guide; hardcoded tier model lists replaced with a `council_health_check` pointer. The env reference was audited against `unified_config`: **21 documented variables didn't exist** — four renamed to their real ADR-031 names, ADR-031 YAML-only knobs re-labelled with their YAML paths, and never-shipped rows removed (canonical generated reference lands with the #448 drift guards).
- **`gate --tier` + accurate bundled skills (#445)** — `llm-council gate` gains `--tier {quick,balanced,high,reasoning}` (tier-sovereign models/timeouts/input caps, matching the verify tool); `unclear_reason` and `confidence_calibrated` flow through both gate output formats via the shared formatter. All three bundled SKILL.md files now execute against the shipped CLI (invocations corrected to `llm-council gate`, phantom `--timeout` flag removed, version claims fixed) and council-verify documents the ADR-047 UNCLEAR routing table.
- **`consult_council` Python facade (#444)** — the API the published quickstart always documented now exists: `from llm_council import consult_council` returns a `CouncilResult` (`.synthesis`, `.metadata`, `.model_responses`, `.raw`) with MCP-tool-parity tier semantics (confidence → tier contract → tier-sovereign timeouts; unknown confidence falls back to `high`; unknown `verdict_type` raises — it changes the output contract, so it is never silently coerced). Docs-as-spec fix from the 2026-07-03 documentation review.

## [0.32.0] - 2026-07-03

**Council Quality Benchmark (ADR-048)** — epic [#421](https://github.com/amiable-dev/llm-council/issues/421). The core product claim becomes measurable: a governed golden dataset with drift regression, a quality-per-dollar configuration matrix from ADR-011 actuals ("when does deliberation pay?"), harness-regenerated results publication, and DeepEval/RAGAS bridges. Spend is capped per-run and per-month with honest unknown-cost accounting; CI never spends (mocked-council tests only; nightly workflow only).

### Added

- **Publication + eval bridges (ADR-048 P3, #420)** — `llm-council bench report --publish docs/bench-results.md` regenerates the results page FROM the harness output (reproducibility fields mandatory: dataset version, date, spend, methodology pointer — never hand-edited). Thin dependency-free adapters let external eval suites drive the council as a target: `make_council_eval_callable` (DeepEval-style prompt→answer) and `council_to_ragas_row` (synthesis as answer, stage-1 drafts as contexts), each with a round-trip example under `examples/eval_bridges/`.
- **Quality-per-dollar config matrix (ADR-048 P2, #419)** — `llm-council bench matrix --configs solo-members,council,graduated` runs the same dataset across configurations (each member solo, full council, ADR-044 graduated depth) and renders the empirical "when does deliberation pay?" table from ADR-011 actuals. Unknown/zero cost renders `n/a` (never a fabricated ratio); solo configs skip consensus score floors by design; one broken config never aborts the rest. Methodology + caveats in `bench/METHODOLOGY.md`.
- **Golden-dataset drift harness (ADR-048 P1, #418)** — `llm-council bench run|baseline|report` executes the versioned dataset (`bench/dataset/v1/`, 20 original items across four domains, governance doc included) against the council and checks expected-quality envelopes (any-of key-content groups + consensus score floors, never exact-string). Hard per-run spend cap (`LLM_COUNCIL_BENCH_MAX_USD`, $2 default) with graceful partial abort, month-to-date guard (`LLM_COUNCIL_BENCH_MONTHLY_USD`, $30 default) from persisted run artefacts, committed-baseline regression detection, exit codes 0/1/2, and a nightly (never per-PR) workflow with explicit caps. Harness fully unit-tested with mocked councils — zero live spend in CI.

## [0.31.0] - 2026-07-03

**Verifier Calibration & Judge Reliability (ADR-047)** — epic [#417](https://github.com/amiable-dev/llm-council/issues/417). The verify gate becomes trustworthy: UNCLEAR verdicts carry machine-readable causes, confidence is calibrated against observed outcomes (both values surfaced), a shadow-first screening judge cuts gate cost for easy changes, and reviewer agreement is decomposed for position-confound amplification. Everything additive; all behavior changes flag-gated default-off.

### Added

- **Reviewer-agreement decomposition (ADR-047 P4, #416)** — `llm-council bias-report --amplification` decomposes each session's reviewer agreement over the ADR-015/018 store: an `agreement_index` (share of score variance between models vs between reviewers) crossed with `position_alignment` (does the consensus track display order?). High agreement WITH high position alignment flags an amplification suspect — the council converged along the position confound, not quality. Strictly report-only (pure functions, no writes, no gating — test-pinned); ADR-015 small-N caveats apply.
- **Lightweight screening judge (ADR-047 P3, #415)** — opt-in verify pre-gate: a single quick-tier model scores the change against the rubric in seconds. `LLM_COUNCIL_SCREENING=off` (default, byte-identical — a screen adds a model call, so no free shadow) | `shadow` (screen + log every decision with scores to `.council/screening/decisions.jsonl`, full council always runs — measures the screen's own precision first) | `active` (short-circuits to a PASS-with-audit-note only on a unanimous ≥9 across all dimensions). Hard invariants, never tunables: blocking-capable requests (blocking evidence or security focus) and risk-glob paths (auth/security/crypto/payment) are NEVER screened; content cap 5K. Soft-fail: any screen error runs the full council.
- **Confidence calibration (ADR-047 P2, #414)** — `llm-council calibration-report` reproducibly analyzes the verify transcript corpus (`.council/logs`): the current corpus shows the anomaly the ADR predicted — 42/42 FAIL verdicts carry ZERO blocking issues at mean confidence 0.965. `--fit` fits a monotonic (isotonic/PAV) mapping from human dispositions (`.council/calibration/dispositions.jsonl`) and persists it; every VerifyResponse now carries `confidence_calibrated` alongside raw `confidence` (identity mapping until fitted). The PASS threshold consumes the calibrated value only behind `LLM_COUNCIL_CALIBRATED_CONFIDENCE` (default off — flag-off byte-identical, test-pinned).
- **UNCLEAR disambiguation (ADR-047 P1, #413)** — `VerifyResponse.unclear_reason` splits exit-code-2 into machine-readable causes: `infra_failure` (chairman call errored per #403 `error_status` — retry after checking billing/auth), `low_confidence` (deliberation completed below threshold — accept-and-audit per policy), `timeout` (ADR-040 global deadline — re-tier or reduce scope). Exit code stays 2 (compat, additive field); surfaced in the MCP verify output table with routing hints; `None` on pass/fail and on non-deliberated cap results (where the `error` marker governs).

## [0.30.0] - 2026-07-03

**Streaming Deliberation (ADR-046)** — epic [#412](https://github.com/amiable-dev/llm-council/issues/412). The 30–600s spinner becomes a live deliberation view: rich per-model SSE events in a versioned envelope, opt-in chairman token streaming that assembles the identical final result, per-reviewer MCP progress, and the enabling `council.py` split (101K→44K, below the Council review cap). Non-streaming paths are byte-identical throughout.

### Added

- **MCP progress surface (ADR-046 P3, #411)** — per-reviewer stage-2 progress ("<model> reviewed (n/N)") now reaches MCP `ctx.report_progress` (and the HTTP progress channel), wired only when a progress consumer exists — consumer-less runs stay byte-identical (test-pinned). `consult_council` and `verify` tool descriptions document the progress semantics.
- **Chairman token streaming (ADR-046 P2, #410)** — `/v1/council/stream?stream_tokens=true` streams the chairman's synthesis live as `synthesis.delta` events. The streamed path assembles the identical final result object as the non-streamed path (equality-tested); transport failure falls back silently to the regular call; cancellation propagates (never triggers a fallback double-call); streamed usage is reported as unknown per ADR-011 (the stream wire protocol carries no usage data) rather than fabricated. Default off — flag-off byte-identical.
- **Rich SSE stage events (ADR-046 P1, #409)** — the `/v1/council/stream` endpoint now emits per-model events as deliberation progresses: `stage1.response` (each model's answer as it lands), `stage2.review` (each peer review, with parsed ranking + `parse_ok`), `consensus.early_termination` (ADR-044), and `stage3.start` — every event wrapped in a versioned envelope (`v: 1`, `session_id`, `ts`, monotonic `seq`; additive-only). Terminal events keep their ADR-025 names (`council.complete`/`council.error`) for consumer compat. Non-streaming paths are byte-identical: the callbacks are wired only when a stream consumer is attached (test-pinned batch path). Also fixes a latent bug where the non-gateway query path passed `shared_results` positionally into `reasoning_params`.

### Changed

- **council.py split below the Council review cap (ADR-046 P0, #408)** — verbatim moves into `council_stages.py` (stage functions, 40K), `council_rankings.py` (ranking parse/Borda/shadow votes, 17K), and `council_usage.py` (shared constants + ADR-011 usage accounting, 4K), leaving `council.py` at 44K (was 101K). Full back-compat: `council.py` re-exports every moved name; patched-attr config semantics preserved; suite count identical. Unblocks self-review of ADR-046 streaming changes.

## [0.29.0] - 2026-07-03

**MCP 2026-07-28 Adoption (ADR-045)** — epic [#407](https://github.com/amiable-dev/llm-council/issues/407). Early, correct adoption of the MCP 2026-07-28 spec cycle: a durable Tasks core (SDK wiring gated on the stable v2 SDK), SEP-2127 Server Card discovery, and a stateless-deployment audit with a two-instance smoke suite. Post-spec re-checks tracked in [#425](https://github.com/amiable-dev/llm-council/issues/425). Also ships the #397 chairman error-surfacing fix.

### Added

- **Stateless-deployment audit + two-instance smoke (ADR-045 Phase 3, #406)** — full inventory of MCP-path state that outlives a request (`docs/adr-045-p3-state-inventory.md`): the durable `TaskStore` is the load-bearing cross-instance contract and is now pinned by a two-instance smoke suite (lifecycle split across instances, two-process concurrency, torn-read guard). Per-instance circuit breakers/metrics/caches are documented as deliberate (optimality, not correctness). One true defect fixed: the layer-event accumulator was unbounded in long-lived processes — now a ring buffer (`MAX_LAYER_EVENTS=1000`).
- **MCP Server Card (ADR-045 Phase 2, #405)** — public discovery metadata per SEP-2127, generated from the live FastMCP tool registry (drift-tested): served by the HTTP server at `/server-card` and `/.well-known/mcp/server-card.json`, printable via `llm-council server-card`, with a static `server-card.json` committed for registry submission. Validated against the experimental-extension RC schema; **re-check against the final schema after the MCP 2026-07-28 release**.
- **MCP Tasks core layer (ADR-045 Phase 1, #404)** — groundwork for the MCP 2026-07-28 Tasks primitive (long-running deliberations that survive client disconnects): a durable `TaskStore` under `.council/tasks/` (24h expiry, size-capped eviction, in-memory fallback), 128-bit capability task ids with no enumeration API, a `LLM_COUNCIL_MCP_TASKS` kill-switch, and SDK feature-detection. The MCP wiring itself is **blocked pending the stable SDK v2** (targeted 2026-07-28 alongside the spec; the current pin is `mcp<1.27`) — synchronous tool behaviour is byte-identical until then.

### Fixed

- **Stage-3 chairman failures no longer swallow the underlying error (#397)** — `stage3_synthesize_final` used `query_model`, which collapses every failure (billing 402, auth, rate-limit, timeout) into `None`, so the fallback emitted only 'Error: Unable to generate final synthesis.' During the 2026-07-02 OpenRouter billing outage this made an infra failure look like a dead chairman model. Stage 3 now uses the status-preserving call and surfaces the failure class and detail in the synthesis text (`… (auth_error: Payment required (402): …)`), in structured `error_status`/`error_detail` fields, and in a warning log.

## [0.28.0] - 2026-07-03

**Compute-Optimal Deliberation (ADR-044)** — epic [#394](https://github.com/amiable-dev/llm-council/issues/394). The write-only performance index (ADR-026 P3) and cost-per-quality signals (ADR-011 P3) now power adaptive routing: performance-aware selection, early consensus termination, and a graduated deliberation-depth cascade. Everything is **default-OFF**, flag-gated, and LayerEvent-audited (route receipts); flag-off behaviour is byte-identical. Supersedes draft ADRs 039 (LLMRouter) and 043 (Pareto Router).

### Added

- **Graduated deliberation depth (ADR-044 Phase 3, #392)** — a new `graduated_depth` module (default **OFF**, `LLM_COUNCIL_GRADUATED_DEPTH`) provides the compute-optimal cascade: a depth ladder single → mini-council(3) → full council with prefix-superset model sets, so shallow-pass responses are always reused and escalation only *adds* models. Escalation is gated on known-low consensus signals (CSS / verdict confidence; unknown signals never escalate), priced via the ADR-011 estimator, optionally vetoed by the opt-in `BudgetEnforcer` (auditable, never a silent downgrade), and emits `L2_DELIBERATION_ESCALATION`. Includes `merge_usage_summaries` for correct cost accounting across rungs. Shipped as a bounded decision engine + documented hook (`plan_escalation`) rather than hot-path rewiring.
- **Early consensus termination (ADR-044 Phase 2, #391)** — during Stage-2 peer review, once the leading response's Borda margin is mathematically unassailable given the reviewers still outstanding, the remaining reviewer calls can be cancelled (flag `LLM_COUNCIL_EARLY_CONSENSUS`, default **OFF**). Off = **shadow mode**: the would-have-terminated point and estimated cost saved (from ADR-011 history) are logged so savings are measurable before enabling. Active terminations emit an auditable `L3_EARLY_CONSENSUS_TERMINATION` LayerEvent (votes saved, reviewers cancelled, est. cost saved); usage aggregation for completed reviewers is unaffected and dissent extraction still runs.
- **Performance-aware model selection (ADR-044 Phase 1, #390)** — the internal performance index (ADR-026 P3, previously write-only) now optionally blends into candidate quality scores during tier selection: `w·live + (1−w)·static` with `w` stepped by the index's confidence tier (0.3/0.6/0.8; cold start stays fully static). **Default OFF** (`LLM_COUNCIL_PERFORMANCE_SELECTION`); flag-off behaviour is byte-identical. When blending changes the selected model set, an auditable `L2_PERFORMANCE_SELECTION_APPLIED` LayerEvent records the static vs blended selections (route receipt). Soft-fail: tracker errors never affect selection.

## [0.27.1] - 2026-07-02

Tech-debt cleanup, part 2 (epic #382): internal perf + a scoring fix for the opt-in cost-aware ranking, and the `verification/api.py` module split — no public API changes.

### Changed

- **`verification/api.py` split into submodules (#380)** — the ~90K module now delegates to `verification/constants.py` (tier caps, extension whitelists, timeouts), `verification/schemas.py` (request/response models + validation patterns), `verification/evidence_render.py` (ADR-042 evidence budgeting/rendering + input-metrics helpers), and `verification/file_ops.py` (git snapshot + file-fetching operations). All moved names are re-exported from `verification.api` verbatim for backward compatibility; behaviour is unchanged (verbatim moves, full suite green). `api.py` drops to ~39K — back under the Council review cap, so future changes to the verify pipeline are reviewable whole.

### Fixed

- **Cost data no longer penalizes ranking (#384 review)** — in the opt-in cost-aware scoring, a raw min-max normalization sent the lowest value-for-money model to 0.0 while unknown-cost models kept their raw quality (having cost data acted as a penalty). Quality-per-cost is now rescaled onto the cost-known cohort's own quality range: value-for-money reorders models within their cohort's span and never drops one below its quality floor.
- **Cost-aware scoring no longer does N+1 store reads (#384)** — `get_all_cost_aware_scores` (opt-in, ADR-011 Phase 3) read the JSONL performance store once per model via `get_model_index`; it now reads the store once and groups records by model — bounded reads and a single consistent snapshot for the quality-per-cost pass. New `_index_from_records` helper aggregates from already-loaded records; `get_model_index` behaviour unchanged.

## [0.27.0] - 2026-07-02

Follow-up tech-debt cleanup (epic #382): the OpenRouter gateway now surfaces reasoning traces and streams for real, plus performance-tracker correctness fixes.

### Added

- **OpenRouter gateway: reasoning trace + real streaming (#375)** — `GatewayResponse` now carries `reasoning_details` (o1/o3/deepseek-r1 reasoning traces were captured but dropped on the gateway path), and `complete_stream` now performs a true SSE stream yielding incremental content deltas instead of buffering the whole response into one chunk.

### Fixed

- **Performance tracker minor debt (#377)** — `record_session` now stamps its `session_id` onto every metric as the authoritative id (the parameter was previously unused) and no longer mutates the caller's objects; the decay weight clamps future-dated timestamps; clarified that `get_quality_score`'s 0–100 scale (selection-facing) vs `get_all_model_scores`' 0–1 scale (percentile math) is intentional, and that latency percentiles are intentionally unweighted.

## [0.26.0] - 2026-07-02

Follow-up & tech-debt cleanup from the ADR-011 cost-accounting epic (batched as [#373](https://github.com/amiable-dev/llm-council/issues/373)): one additive enhancement (token/cost in `VerifyResponse`) plus correctness fixes to the OpenRouter gateway, the performance tracker, and the reasoning path.

### Added

- **Token/cost in `VerifyResponse` (ADR-011 Phase 2 follow-up, #366)** — `verify` now surfaces per-run token and cost totals (`prompt_tokens`, `completion_tokens`, `total_tokens`, `cost_usd`, `cost_known`, `cached_tokens`) under `input_metrics`, sourced from the council usage summary. `cost_known` distinguishes a genuine $0 from unknown cost; the fields are omitted entirely when usage is unavailable.

### Fixed

- **`reasoning_params` no longer dropped in `query_models_with_progress` (#365)** — the progress-callback query path (used by the council) now threads `reasoning_params` through to each model call, matching `query_models_parallel` and the gateway path (ADR-026). Reasoning-effort injection was previously silently lost on this path.
- **Performance tracker correctness (#370)** — (1) `get_quality_percentile` now excludes the model itself from its own ranking (self-inclusion inflated the rank by 1/N and biased the ADR-029 graduation gate); (2) `_calculate_decay_weight` docstring corrected — `decay_days` is an e-folding time-constant, not a half-life (behaviour unchanged); (3) documented the intentional 0–1 (`get_all_model_scores`) vs 0–100 (`get_quality_score`) scale split and the intentionally-unweighted parse-success rate.
- **OpenRouter gateway correctness (#367)** — (1) the API key is no longer frozen at import: `OpenRouterGateway` resolves it per-request via the ADR-013 chain, so a request-scoped BYOK key is honored (was silently bypassed); (2) null response `content` (e.g. a tool-call-only turn) is coerced to `""` so downstream never sees `None`; (3) `tool_calls`/`tool_call_id` are now propagated in message conversion instead of being silently dropped.

## [0.25.0] - 2026-07-01

**Cost and token accounting (ADR-011)** — a four-phase epic ([#359](https://github.com/amiable-dev/llm-council/issues/359)) that makes LLM spend transparent and optimizable: capture & surfacing (Phase 1), OpenTelemetry-standard observability (Phase 2), cost-per-quality optimization (Phase 3), and an opt-in budget gate (Phase 4). Everything is additive and backward-compatible — new behaviour is opt-in or soft-fail, and the council never fails a request because of cost accounting.

### Added

- **Opt-in budget enforcement (ADR-011, Phase 4)** — a new `budget/` module (DEFAULT OFF) adds a pre-query `CostEstimator` (low/expected/high USD estimate from per-model cost history) and a tiered `BudgetEnforcer`: `STRICT` rejects if even the high estimate exceeds the budget, `BALANCED` rejects on the expected estimate (warns on high), `PERMISSIVE` warns only. Between stages it can abort **gracefully** (returning partial results) but never aborts a completion in flight (ADR-040). Every reject/warn/abort emits an auditable `L1_BUDGET_DECISION` LayerEvent — budget never causes a silent tier change (ADR-024). Enable with `LLM_COUNCIL_BUDGET_ENFORCEMENT=true` and `LLM_COUNCIL_BUDGET_MODE=strict|balanced|permissive`.

- **Cost-per-quality optimization (ADR-011, Phase 3)** — the internal performance index now carries per-model cost (`ModelSessionMetric.cost_usd`, `ModelPerformanceIndex.mean_cost_usd`) and derives a **Borda-per-dollar** value signal (`quality_per_cost`). A new **opt-in** cost-aware ranking (`InternalPerformanceTracker.get_all_cost_aware_scores`) is byte-for-byte identical to plain quality scoring unless `LLM_COUNCIL_COST_AWARE_SELECTION=true` — the single audited path by which cost may influence model selection; unknown-cost models keep their quality score (never penalized for missing data). Cost is recorded from the council's per-model usage (only when actually reported), and unknown costs are excluded from the mean rather than counted as $0.

- **Cost/token observability (ADR-011, Phase 2)** — the council now emits per-model token and cost metrics through the existing metrics adapter (ADR-030) using **OpenTelemetry GenAI semantic conventions** (`gen_ai.client.token.usage` histogram tagged `gen_ai.token.type`/`gen_ai.request.model`, plus a `llm_council.cost.usd` gauge), so any OTLP sink (PostHog, Grafana, Datadog) ingests them with zero custom mapping. Emission is soft-fail (never affects a run). Ships `examples/observability/` — an OTel-Collector compose overlay (Prometheus + Grafana, OTLP export to PostHog), a Grafana dashboard, and collector/prometheus configs. Enable with `LLM_COUNCIL_METRICS_ENABLED=true` + `LLM_COUNCIL_METRICS_BACKEND=prometheus`.
- **Cost and token accounting (ADR-011, Phase 1)** — the council now captures and reports USD cost alongside tokens. A per-gateway `CostResolver` (`gateway/cost_resolver.py`) stamps `cost_usd` + a `cost_source` provenance tag onto every call — `provider` ground-truth for OpenRouter/Requesty (capturing the previously-discarded inline `usage.cost`), `registry_estimate` from `registry.yaml` pricing for Direct APIs, and `local_zero` for Ollama — so an estimate is never presented as a bill. `metadata["usage"]` now carries `{by_stage, by_model, total}` with `cost_usd`/`cached_tokens` (per-model uses reviewer-primary attribution), exposed as a typed, OpenAPI-documented `usage` field on the HTTP `CouncilResponse` and as a progressive-disclosure **Cost & Tokens** summary in MCP `consult_council` (one line by default; full per-model/per-stage breakdown only under `include_details`). The MCP fallback path (`run_council_with_fallback`) now aggregates usage into metadata too (previously absent — the MCP surface had no token data). Cost accounting is soft-fail and never breaks a council run. Surfacing token/cost in `VerifyResponse` is deferred to a follow-up (verification telemetry, ADR-041).

## [0.24.45] - 2026-06-16

Verify-gate robustness pass, from a real epic-loop session that "kept reporting council timeouts." Investigation of the live transcripts and `.council/logs` found the council server healthy — the pain was four distinct verify-layer defects conflated as "timeouts". All four are fixed here.

### Fixed

- **`verify` no longer crashes with `bad operand type for unary -: 'str'`** ([#354](https://github.com/amiable-dev/llm-council/issues/354)) — `detect_score_rank_mismatch` (`council.py`) sorted candidate labels with `key=lambda x: -scores.get(x, 0)`. `scores` is `Dict[str, Any]` populated from untrusted model output; when a model emits a score as a string (`"9"`, `"N/A"`, `""`) the unary minus raised `TypeError` and aborted the entire verification with **no verdict produced** (the intermittent, input-size-correlated "internal crash" seen in real usage). Scores are now coerced via a new `_coerce_score()` helper — numeric values pass through, non-numeric sort lowest, nothing raises.
- **`verify` no longer reports FAIL/UNCLEAR for changes the council approved** ([#355](https://github.com/amiable-dev/llm-council/issues/355)) — two compounding bugs in the verdict layer. (1) The pipeline already obtains the chairman's **structured BINARY verdict** (`verdict_result` from `stage3_synthesize_final`, ADR-025b) but `build_verification_result` discarded it and re-derived the verdict with a naive prose regex that fires on *negated* mentions ("no **failures**", "**critical** issues resolved") — across 44 persisted real runs only 1 passed despite frequent unanimous approvals. The structured verdict is now authoritative; regex extraction is a fallback only. (2) `extract_blocking_issues` matched the bare word `CRITICAL|MAJOR|MINOR` anywhere in prose (`[:\s]+`), so approval text like "the critical issues have been resolved" and "No blocking issues were identified" was fabricated into `CRITICAL` blockers that drove false gate failures. It now requires a genuine line-anchored, colon-delimited marker (`- **CRITICAL**: …`).
- **Verify timeout budget raised so the chairman stage is not starved** ([#356](https://github.com/amiable-dev/llm-council/issues/356)) — `VERIFICATION_TIMEOUT_MULTIPLIER` is now `2.0` (was `1.5`), so the global deadline becomes `balanced` 180s / `high` 360s (was 135s / 270s). On a slow day the `balanced` tier could spend its entire 135s on stage 1 (~62s) + stage 2 (~73s), so stage 3 — the chairman go/no-go — never ran and the gate timed out with **no verdict**, which the MCP client timeout could not fix (the bottleneck was the server's own deadline). The extra headroom lets synthesis complete. Additionally, when stage 3 *is* still starved, the timeout path now **salvages an advisory signal** — the rubric scores and reviewer-agreement confidence recovered from the completed peer-review stage — instead of returning a bare `unclear`/`0.0` (the verdict stays `unclear` since no chairman decision was reached, but the caller gets something actionable).
- **Timeout and input-cap verifications are now persisted to `.council/logs`** ([#356](https://github.com/amiable-dev/llm-council/issues/356)) — the input-cap and `asyncio.TimeoutError` early-return paths returned a result without ever calling `store.write_stage(..., "result", …)`, so timeouts (the dominant real-world failure mode) left **no `result.json`** and were un-investigable after the fact. Both paths now persist via a best-effort `_persist_result_safe()` (a store error never escalates a degraded result into a hard failure).

- **Test suite is compatible with Starlette 1.x** — the unbounded `fastapi>=0.100.0` dependency now resolves to FastAPI 0.137 / Starlette 1.3, where `include_router` produces a nested `_IncludedRouter` route object without a top-level `.path`. Several tests introspected routes with `[route.path for route in app.routes]`, which raised `AttributeError` and turned CI red (the app itself is fine — TestClient integration tests pass on Starlette 1.x). Replaced with a recursive flatten helper that works on both 0.x and 1.x route trees. Surfaced while landing this release; orthogonal to the verdict-layer fixes.

### Changed

- **Input-cap rejection is now a distinct, non-verdict signal** ([#357](https://github.com/amiable-dev/llm-council/issues/357)) — an over-cap payload (e.g. 31K chars at the 30K `balanced` limit) previously returned `verdict="unclear"`/`exit_code=2`, indistinguishable from a deliberated UNCLEAR. Automation that treats UNCLEAR as "accept & proceed" (e.g. epic-loop) would therefore let an **unreviewed oversized input silently pass the gate**. The result now carries `error="input_too_large"` (surfaced on `VerifyResponse`), and the formatted output renders a distinct **"INPUT TOO LARGE — the council did not run"** banner instead of a verdict.

## [0.24.44] - 2026-06-02

### Fixed

- **`verify` no longer crashes when the chairman synthesis is empty/None** — `extract_verdict_from_synthesis` and `extract_blocking_issues` read the synthesis via `stage3_result.get("response", "")`, but the `"response"` key is normally present with a `None` value (e.g. a reasoning-only model returning null content, or a partial/timed-out stage 3), so the `""` default never applied. `None.upper()` / `re.finditer(pattern, None)` then raised `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'upper'` (surfaced to MCP callers as a generic crash), instead of degrading to an `"unclear"` verdict the way a *missing* key already did. Both extractors now coalesce a missing/None synthesis to `""`. Regression tests added in `tests/unit/verification/test_verdict_extractor.py`.
- **`council_health_check` now reports the real API-key source** — `key_source` showed `"unknown"` whenever the key came from the macOS Keychain (ADR-013), because `mcp_server._get_key_source()` only checked the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` env var. It now delegates to `unified_config.get_key_source()`, which tracks the actual resolution path, so a keychain-resolved key reports `"keychain"` (env still reports `"environment"`). Cosmetic only — key resolution itself already worked.

## [0.24.43] - 2026-06-02

### Fixed

- **Health check no longer reports a spurious "error" from a retired probe model** — `council_health_check` (and the OpenRouter / Requesty / direct gateway `health_check()` methods) probed connectivity with a hardcoded `google/gemini-2.0-flash-001`, which has since been retired from OpenRouter and now 404s. The probe failure surfaced as a health-check `error` / `ready: false` even when the council itself was perfectly healthy. The probe model is now a single shared constant `DEFAULT_HEALTH_CHECK_MODEL` in `gateway/base.py` (set to the current, cheap, GA `google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite`) referenced by all four call sites, so the next retirement is a one-line update instead of five scattered literals. The direct gateway's native-API probe ids were refreshed too (`claude-3-5-haiku-20241022` → `claude-haiku-4-5`, `gemini-2.0-flash-001` → `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`).
- **Broken model in the `high` / `reasoning` / `frontier` tier pools** — those pools (and their code-level defaults in `tier_contract.py` / `unified_config.py`) referenced `deepseek/deepseek-v3.2-speciale`, which does not exist on OpenRouter and would fail at request time. Replaced with current DeepSeek models (`deepseek-v4-pro` for high/frontier, the reasoning-specialised `deepseek-r1` for reasoning).

### Changed

- **Tier model pools refreshed against the live OpenRouter catalogue (2026-06-02)** — every tier pool model was cross-checked against `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models`; all 20 pool entries plus the health probe now resolve both in the bundled registry and live on OpenRouter. Changes: `quick`/`balanced` move from the `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview` preview to the GA `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`; `high`/`reasoning`/`frontier` bump Anthropic from `claude-opus-4.7` to the newest `claude-opus-4.8` (same price); `frontier` bumps OpenAI to `gpt-5.5-pro`. Tier aggregators and the default council model list were updated to match. Registry (`models/registry.yaml`) bumped to v1.3 with `gpt-5.5-pro`, `claude-opus-4.8`, `gemini-3.1-flash-lite` (GA), `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`, and `deepseek-v4-pro` added; retired `gemini-2.0-flash-001` and non-existent `deepseek-v3.2-speciale` removed; stale `claude-opus-4.7` pricing corrected to live values.

## [0.24.42] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- **`consult_council` docstring no longer hides the `reasoning` tier** ([#347](https://github.com/amiable-dev/llm-council/pull/347)) — the MCP tool schema for `confidence` is plain `string` with no enum, so the docstring is the only signal an LLM caller gets about valid values. Since 4a4234d (Dec 2025, ADR-012 Section 5) the runtime has accepted `"reasoning"` and routed it to the 600s/300s tier budget, but the docstring still advertised only `"quick" / "balanced" / "high"` with stale pre-ADR-012 duration estimates (`high (~45s)` vs the actual 180s server budget). An LLM consumer of the MCP tool (e.g. a fresh Claude Code instance) reading the schema would correctly conclude reasoning wasn't an option. `verify` and the bundled `council-verify` / `council-review` skills already documented the tier correctly; only `consult_council` was out of sync. The docstring now lists all four runnable tiers (`quick` / `balanced` / `high` / `reasoning`) with their real server budgets and per-model timeouts, and explicitly notes that unknown values silently fall back to `"high"`.

### Added

- **MCP client timeout guidance for slow tiers** ([#347](https://github.com/amiable-dev/llm-council/pull/347)) — new "Configuring MCP Client Timeouts" section in [`docs/integrations/index.md`](docs/integrations/index.md). The council's `high` and `reasoning` tiers can take 3–10 minutes when frontier reasoning models review large inputs (e.g. multi-thousand-line ADRs). MCP clients have their own transport-layer timeout that is **independent of the server's tier budget** — Claude Code's default is around 60s. If the client times out first, callers see "MCP layer timeout" errors even though the council is still working. ADR-012 §419 explicitly chose not to fix this server-side ("We don't control client-side timeouts") and issue [#327](https://github.com/amiable-dev/llm-council/issues/327) has hard data (Stage 1 alone took 652s at high tier on a large input, killed by the client transport). The new section gives an explicit tier→`MCP_TIMEOUT` mapping (`quick` 60000ms, `balanced` 120000ms, `high` 300000ms, `reasoning` 900000ms) and a concrete `.mcp.json` env block. The `consult_council` docstring also carries an inline note pointing callers to this requirement.

## [0.24.41] - 2026-05-26

### Added

- **ADR-043: OpenRouter Pareto Router integration** ([#339](https://github.com/amiable-dev/llm-council/pull/339)) — adds `openrouter/pareto-code` as an optional council seat for coding-focused sessions. The Pareto Router auto-selects a coding model from the quality/cost frontier maintained by Artificial Analysis benchmarks. `min_coding_score` maps to council tiers: quick=0.2, balanced=0.5, high=0.8, reasoning=0.9, frontier=default. Built-in fallback cascading aligns with ADR-023. Three-phase rollout per the ADR: this release implements Phase 1 (integration); Phase 2 (observe Pareto selections + peer review scores) and Phase 3 (expand) follow. Extends ADR-022/023/028. ADR document is in Draft status pending council review; the implementation is shipped behind tier-pool configuration so it's opt-in.

### Fixed

- **`[mcp]` extra no longer ships a broken MCP server** ([#344](https://github.com/amiable-dev/llm-council/issues/344), [#345](https://github.com/amiable-dev/llm-council/pull/345)) — `pip install 'llm-council-core[mcp]'` previously produced a non-functional server: `mcp_server.py` transitively imports `fastapi` via `llm_council.verification.api`, but the `[mcp]` extra declared only `mcp>=1.22.0` (no fastapi / uvicorn). Fresh installs surfaced as `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'`. Three related fixes: (1) `[mcp]` now transitively depends on `[http]` so fastapi / uvicorn track `[http]`'s versions (follows the existing `[all]` transitive-extras pattern); (2) `mcp` upper-pinned to `<1.27` — mcp 1.27.x has breaking API changes from 1.25.x that prevent `mcp_server.py` from importing; (3) `serve_mcp()` now surfaces the real `ImportError` in its error path so future regressions report the actual missing module instead of always blaming `[mcp]`.

## [0.24.40] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed

- **Verify no longer silently amputates large files to 15K chars** ([#342](https://github.com/amiable-dev/llm-council/issues/342)) — `_fetch_file_at_commit_async` clamped every single file to `MAX_FILE_CHARS = 15000` regardless of the active tier's char budget, and `_fetch_files_for_verification_async_with_metadata` then discarded the per-file `truncated` boolean without surfacing it on `VerifyResponse`. End-to-end symptom: a 56,093-char ADR reviewed at the `reasoning` tier (50K budget) reached reviewers as 15,942 chars; reviewers noticed (and said so in their text) but the caller saw `expansion_warnings: null` and a confident verdict. Two-part fix: (1) `_fetch_file_at_commit_async` now accepts a `max_file_chars` parameter and `_fetch_files_for_verification_async_with_metadata` derives it from `TIER_MAX_CHARS[tier]` — at reasoning tier, a single 50K file is now fully readable; per-batch budget scales the same way. (2) Per-file truncation produces a structured `expansion_warnings` entry (`"file '<path>' truncated at N chars (<tier> tier per-file budget)"`) so the caller has a non-textual signal that the review was partial. Backward compat: `_fetch_file_at_commit_async(snapshot_id, path)` without `max_file_chars` still defaults to the legacy 15K constant; the legacy `_fetch_files_for_verification_async` wrapper still works without specifying a tier. The bug had been latent since ADR-040 introduced `TIER_MAX_CHARS` — the per-file inner cap was sized for a multi-file world and never refactored when single-file ADR review became the common case.

## [0.24.39] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed

- **Verify snapshot resolver no longer silently returns empty content** ([#340](https://github.com/amiable-dev/llm-council/issues/340)) — when `target_paths` couldn't be resolved at the given `snapshot_id` (e.g. commit not present in the daemon's local checkout, push-replication race, paths missing at that commit), `run_verification` previously sent a boilerplate-only prompt (~916 chars) to the council and returned UNCLEAR. Skill rules told callers to "accept and move on", making the bug undetectable end-to-end. Three compounding defects fixed: (1) `_build_verification_prompt` now uses the metadata-aware fetch variant — `expansion_warnings` / `expanded_paths` / `paths_truncated` are no longer discarded; they're surfaced on `VerifyResponse` for every call. (2) When non-empty `target_paths` resolves to zero files, the endpoint raises `SnapshotResolutionError` → HTTP 422 with `{error: "snapshot_resolution_failed", snapshot_id, unresolved_paths, expansion_warnings}` (the MCP wrapper mirrors the same shape, parallel to `BlockingEvidenceTooLarge`). Partial resolution still produces a verdict — the warnings just show up on the response. (3) `_get_git_object_type` and `_git_ls_tree_z_name_only` now log git's stderr at WARN with `snapshot_id` + `path` instead of swallowing it under bare `except Exception: pass`, so operators can diagnose missing-fetch / unknown-revision cases.

## [0.24.38] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed

- **Bundled skills synced** ([#338](https://github.com/amiable-dev/llm-council/pull/338)) — `.github/skills/` (dev copy) and `src/llm_council/skills/bundled/` (shipped copy) had drifted across all three bundled skills:
  - `council-verify`: ADR-042 evidence content (Evidence section + `references/evidence.md` + compatibility bump to `>= 2.1`) was missing from bundled — introduced in v0.24.37.
  - `council-review`: ADR-040 timeout-behavior section + `completed_stages`/`timeout_fired` schema fields were never synced to bundled (pre-existing drift, surfaced by the new regression test).
  - `council-gate`: same ADR-040 timeout-handling section missing from bundled (pre-existing drift).
  Synced all three bundled copies to match the dev copies. Added `tests/unit/test_bundled_skills_in_sync.py` as a regression guard — fails on any future drift between the two trees, with an error message that tells the editor exactly how to fix it. Users who ran `llm-council install-skills` from any version up to v0.24.37 should upgrade to v0.24.38 and re-install to get the up-to-date skill content.

## [0.24.37] - 2026-05-13

### Added

- **ADR-042: Verify evidence injection** ([#336](https://github.com/amiable-dev/llm-council/issues/336)) — pre-computed analysis output from upstream tools (linters, slop detectors, custom checkers) can now be passed to verify calls via a new optional `evidence` parameter on `POST /v1/council/verify` and the MCP `verify` tool. Each item carries `source`, `format` (markdown/json/text), `content`, `strength` (informational/blocking), and optional `evidence_id`. Council renders evidence inside `<evidence_item>` XML-sentinel wrappers with tilde-fenced bodies (prevents prompt-injection via heading collisions and fence escapes). The Chairman synthesis prompt is extended to require a fenced JSON `evidence_dispositions` block with a `status` enum (`acknowledged | confirmed | rejected | unresolved | not_reviewed_due_to_budget | parser_error`). `VerifyResponse` gains `evidence_summary` (one disposition per submitted item, including dropped-by-budget) and `evidence_warnings` (structured budgeting notes). A new `evidence.json` transcript artefact is persisted alongside `request.json`/`stage[1-3].json`/`result.json`. `input_metrics` gains evidence-specific counters; raw source/version strings are intentionally kept out of telemetry dimensions (cardinality hygiene). Oversized blocking evidence triggers a structured HTTP 422 (and a mirrored MCP error blob) rather than being silently dropped. Backward compatible — `evidence=None` produces byte-identical prompts to pre-ADR-042 behaviour (locked by a golden hash regression test). See [docs/adr/ADR-042-verify-evidence-injection.md](docs/adr/ADR-042-verify-evidence-injection.md) for the design and [docs/adr/ADR-042-implementation-spec.md](docs/adr/ADR-042-implementation-spec.md) for the prescriptive spec.

## [0.24.36] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed

- **Security Scanning workflow repaired** ([#332](https://github.com/amiable-dev/llm-council/pull/332)) — two unrelated failures had been blocking the `Security Scanning` status badge since mid-March:
  - `aquasecurity/trivy-action@0.34.2` no longer resolved. The original unprefixed tags (`0.0.1`–`0.34.2`) were deleted during remediation of the March 2026 trivy-action supply chain compromise ([CVE-2026-33634](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/security/advisories/GHSA-69fq-xp46-6x23)) and republished with a `v` prefix. Bumped to `v0.36.0` (published 2026-04-22, post-remediation) and pinned to commit SHA for supply-chain robustness.
  - Gitleaks kept flagging a historical OpenRouter key in commit `b8ad10d` (tagged in v0.3.0, Dec 2025). Key already revoked; added a commit-level allowlist entry so scheduled scans pass.
- **Supply chain exposure assessment:** No exposure. Last successful Trivy run was 2026-03-12, seven days before the 12-hour attack window on 2026-03-19. No master pushes occurred during or after the window until this fix, so no malicious trivy-action code ever reached a runner.

## [0.24.35] - 2026-04-23

### Changed

- **April 2026 model refresh** — refreshed tier defaults to incorporate newly-available models:
  - **Claude Opus 4.6 → 4.7** in `high`, `reasoning`, and `frontier` tier pools + aggregators. Opus 4.7 (GA on OpenRouter since Apr 16, 2026) ships a 13% coding-benchmark lift over 4.6, 3× vision resolution, and a 1M context window. Pricing unchanged per Anthropic.
  - **Balanced tier aggregator and pool: `gpt-5.3-chat` → `gpt-5.4-mini`** — newer model, 400K context (was 128K), ~57% cheaper input / 68% cheaper output, with reasoning support.
  - Updated `CouncilConfig.models` default, `TIER_AGGREGATORS`, `_DEFAULT_TIER_MODEL_POOLS`, and `llm_council.yaml`.

### Added

- **Registry entries** in `src/llm_council/models/registry.yaml`:
  - `anthropic/claude-opus-4.7` (FRONTIER, 1M ctx, $15/$75 per 1M)
  - `openai/gpt-5.4-mini` (STANDARD, 400K ctx, $0.75/$4.50 per 1M, reasoning)
  - `openai/gpt-5.4-nano` (ECONOMY, 400K ctx, $0.20/$1.25 per 1M, reasoning)
  - Older entries retained for backwards compatibility.

## [0.24.34] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed

- **Concurrent verify shotgunning** ([#327](https://github.com/amiable-dev/llm-council/issues/327)) — agents fired 4 verify calls within 15 seconds with progressively fewer files, overwhelming the MCP server. Replaced "Handling Verdicts" with stricter "Rules" section: one call at a time, one call per commit, no scope-reduction retries.

## [0.24.33] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed

- **Calling agents stuck in verify retry loops** ([#327](https://github.com/amiable-dev/llm-council/issues/327)) — agents retried FAIL/UNCLEAR verdicts instead of fixing code, burning 26+ minutes on unchanged snapshots. Added "Handling Verdicts" section to council-verify skill with explicit PASS/FAIL/UNCLEAR action guidance and a "never retry same snapshot" rule.

## [0.24.32] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed

- **Verification timeouts on large code inputs** ([#327](https://github.com/amiable-dev/llm-council/issues/327)) — default tier `high` used frontier models (opus-4.6, gpt-5.4-pro) that took 600+ seconds on 25K+ token inputs, exceeding the 270s global deadline. Changed default to `balanced` (mid-tier models, 90s deadline). Added tier selection guidance to skill based on content size and criticality.

## [0.24.31] - 2026-03-08

### Added

- **ADR-041: Verification telemetry wiring** - Wire existing performance tracking infrastructure into verification pipeline
  - Per-stage timing (`stage1_elapsed_ms`, `stage2_elapsed_ms`, `stage3_elapsed_ms`) captured in verification results and transcripts
  - Total elapsed time, global deadline, and `budget_utilization` ratio for timeout tuning
  - `input_metrics` (`content_chars`, `tier_max_chars`, `num_models`, `num_reviewers`, `tier`) for input size correlation analysis
  - Timing data preserved on timeout via `partial_state` and `finally` blocks
  - `persist_session_performance_data()` wired to verification pipeline (ADR-026 Phase 3 no longer dead code)
  - Performance tracker failures isolated from verification results (telemetry never fails verification)
  - `VerifyResponse` schema extended with optional `timing` and `input_metrics` fields

## [0.24.29] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed

- **ADR-040: Verification timeout guardrails** - Fix verify/review tools hanging for 10-57 minutes
  - **Bug fix**: `stage2_collect_rankings()` now accepts `timeout` and `models` params, honoring tier contract instead of defaulting to 120s and global config models
  - **Bug fix**: `stage3_synthesize_final()` now accepts `timeout` param, passed through to `query_model()`
  - **Global timeout**: `run_verification()` wraps pipeline in `asyncio.wait_for()` with deadline derived from `tier_contract.deadline_ms * 1.5`
  - **Partial results**: On timeout, returns `partial=True, timeout_fired=True` with `verdict=unclear` instead of hanging indefinitely
  - **Input size guardrails**: Per-tier character limits (quick: 15K, balanced: 30K, high/reasoning: 50K) reject oversized inputs with helpful error
  - **Pre-flight info**: First progress callback includes tier, content size, model count, and deadline estimate
  - **Enhanced Stage 2 progress**: Per-model progress reporting during peer review (total_steps now includes stage2 models)
  - **Formatting**: Both full and compact verification formatters now surface timeout/partial indicators

## [0.24.22] - 2026-02-06

### Changed

- **Model Upgrade**: Replaced `anthropic/claude-opus-4.5` with `anthropic/claude-opus-4.6` across all configurations
  - Updated tier pools (high, reasoning, frontier) in `unified_config.py`
  - Updated tier aggregators in `tier_contract.py`
  - Updated model registry (`registry.yaml`)
  - Updated `llm_council.yaml` user-facing config
  - Updated all documentation (README, ADRs, blog posts, getting-started guide)
  - Closes #323

## [0.24.21] - 2026-01-30

### Security

- **CRITICAL: Remove API key exposure in health check** (CVE pending)
  - Removed `key_preview` field that exposed first 20 characters of API key
  - Removed `working_directory` debug field from health check response
  - Health check result is returned to MCP clients (LLMs), so partial keys were being sent to models
  - **Action required**: Users should rotate their OpenRouter API keys if they used `council_health_check()`

## [0.24.20] - 2026-01-21

### Changed

- **Default Council Model**: Replaced `openai/gpt-5.2-pro` with `openai/gpt-5.2` in all tier pools
  - Reasoning tier now uses `gpt-5.2` instead of expensive `gpt-5.2-pro`
  - Frontier tier now uses `gpt-5.2` instead of `gpt-5.2-pro`
  - Default council models list updated
  - Cost reduction while maintaining quality (both are frontier-tier models)

## [0.24.19] - 2026-01-16

### Fixed

- **Cold Start Protection**: Added `min_samples` config (default: 10) for rollback metrics
  - Prevents false 100% rate from first failure (1/1 = 100% triggering immediate rollback)
  - Rate calculation returns 0.0 until minimum sample threshold is met
  - New env var: `LLM_COUNCIL_ROLLBACK_MIN_SAMPLES`

## [0.24.18] - 2026-01-16

### Fixed

- **Metrics Load Error Handling**: Added logging for corrupted metrics file recovery
  - Logs warning with file path and error details via `logging.warning()`
  - Documents "fail-safe" design: empty metrics = no thresholds breached = fast path stays enabled
  - Graceful degradation when historical data is unavailable

## [0.24.17] - 2026-01-16

### Fixed

- **Rollback Monitoring Enabled Flag**: Added proper `enabled` checks
  - `record()` now skips recording when monitoring is disabled
  - `check_thresholds()` returns False immediately when disabled
- **RollbackConfig.from_env()**: Now loads all parameters from environment
  - Added: `error_multiplier`, `wildcard_timeout_threshold`
  - Previously only loaded `enabled` and `window_size`
- **File Locking Documentation**: Clarified atomic replacement design
  - `_truncate_file()` uses atomic `os.replace()` (no lock needed)
  - File locking applies to `_load()` and `_save_record()` only

## [0.24.16] - 2026-01-16

### Fixed

- **Duplicate SSE Events**: Removed `DELIBERATION_START` and `COMPLETE` from webhook subscription
  - These events are emitted manually by `_council_runner.py`
  - Subscribing to them via webhook caused duplicate events in SSE stream
- **Truncation Race Condition**: Changed from open-then-lock to atomic file replacement
  - Uses `tempfile.mkstemp()` + `os.replace()` for POSIX atomic rename
  - Prevents data loss from concurrent truncation operations

## [0.24.15] - 2026-01-16

### Fixed

- **ERROR_RATE Rollback Trigger**: Added missing check in `check_thresholds()`
  - Now checks `error_rate > baseline * error_multiplier` per ADR-020
  - Uses 5% baseline with 1.5x multiplier (7.5% threshold)
- **request_id Security**: Prevented payload overwrite in SSE events
  - Moved `request_id` after `**payload.data` spread in dictionary construction
  - Prevents malicious payload from injecting false request IDs

### Security

- **File Locking**: Added `fcntl` file locking for metrics persistence
  - Shared lock (`LOCK_SH`) for reading
  - Exclusive lock (`LOCK_EX`) for writing
  - Graceful fallback to no-op on Windows (no fcntl)

## [0.24.14] - 2026-01-16

### Fixed

- **Thread Safety**: Fixed race conditions in SSE event handling
  - Uses `asyncio.call_soon_threadsafe()` for event queue operations
  - Prevents concurrent modification of `events_seen` set
- **Fast Path Case Sensitivity**: Fixed keyword matching in complexity classifier
  - Keywords now matched case-insensitively
- **Blocking I/O**: Moved file operations off event loop
  - Metrics persistence uses non-blocking writes

### Changed

- **Council Runner Cleanup**: Added task cancellation on client disconnect
  - Prevents zombie LLM API calls when SSE client disconnects
  - Uses `asyncio.wait_for()` with timeout for graceful cleanup

## [0.24.5] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed

- **Build fix**: Use `artifacts` instead of `force-include` for bundled skills packaging
  - Previous configuration tried to include `.github/skills` which doesn't exist in sdist
  - Skills are now correctly bundled from `src/llm_council/skills/bundled/`

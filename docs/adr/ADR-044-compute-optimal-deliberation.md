# ADR-044: Compute-Optimal Deliberation

**Status:** Draft 2026-07-02
**Date:** 2026-07-02
**Decision Makers:** Chris Joseph, LLM Council
**Related:** ADR-026 (Phase 3 — the index this wires in), ADR-011 (Phase 3 — cost-per-quality), ADR-040 (Options E/F), ADR-020 (Tier-1 fast path), ADR-024 (layer sovereignty), ADR-036 (CSS)
**Supersedes:** ADR-039 (LLMRouter — external router no longer needed), ADR-043 (Pareto Router — folded in as an optional pool source)

## Context

### The write-only index

The internal performance index (ADR-026 Phase 3) records per-model, per-session
quality (Borda), latency, parse success, and — since v0.25.0 (ADR-011 Phase 3) —
**cost**, deriving a Borda-per-dollar `quality_per_cost` signal with an opt-in
cost-aware ranking (`get_all_cost_aware_scores`, `LLM_COUNCIL_COST_AWARE_SELECTION`).

**None of it influences selection.** Verified 2026-07-02: `metadata/selection.py`
scores candidates purely from *static* metadata (`calculate_model_score`,
`_estimate_quality_score` → registry benchmarks), with zero references to
`InternalPerformanceTracker`. Two epics of telemetry (v0.25.x–v0.27.x) are a
dormant asset. ADR-040's Options E (tiered Stage 2) and F (early consensus
termination) were deferred "pending observability data" — that data now exists
(ADR-041 timing + ADR-011 cost).

### The field (July 2026)

- **Learned routing/cascades**: RouteLLM-class routers cut ~85% of cost while
  retaining ~95% of top-model quality; production gateways report 30–50% spend
  reduction from routing alone.
- **Compute-optimal test-time scaling**: spending inference compute adaptively
  (more deliberation only where the query needs it) dominates fixed-depth
  strategies; heterogeneous-model ensembles are explicitly called out as
  underexplored — this project is one.
- **Route auditability** ("route receipts") is emerging as a trust requirement —
  aligning with ADR-024's explicit/auditable-escalation principle.

### Why the drafts die

ADR-039 (NVIDIA LLMRouter) and ADR-043 (OpenRouter Pareto) both outsourced
routing intelligence to external dependencies. With the in-house index now
carrying real quality/latency/cost history per model, an internal, auditable
wiring is simpler, offline-capable (Sovereign Orchestrator, ADR-026), and keeps
the routing signal aligned with the council's own Borda ground truth rather
than a third party's benchmark. ADR-039 is superseded outright; ADR-043's
`openrouter/pareto-code` remains available as an ordinary pool entry if wanted.

## Decision

Make deliberation **compute-optimal** in three opt-in, individually-shippable
phases. Sovereignty guardrail (ADR-024): every behaviour below is **default
OFF**, flag-gated, emits an auditable `LayerEvent` when it changes an outcome,
and soft-fails to today's behaviour on any error. Cost/quality history may
influence routing **only** through these audited paths.

### Phase 1 — Performance-aware selection (ADR-026 P3 completion)

Blend the live index into candidate scoring in `metadata/selection.py`:

- `_estimate_quality_score` consults `InternalPerformanceTracker` when the
  model's `confidence_level` is ≥ PRELIMINARY (≥10 samples): blend
  `live = tracker score`, `static = registry estimate` as
  `w·live + (1−w)·static`, with `w` stepping up by confidence tier
  (PRELIMINARY 0.3, MODERATE 0.6, HIGH 0.8). INSUFFICIENT → static only
  (cold-start safe).
- When `LLM_COUNCIL_COST_AWARE_SELECTION=true` (the existing ADR-011 flag),
  the blended quality feeds the cost-aware ranking so value-for-money
  reorders within the quality span (cohort-floor rule from v0.27.1 applies).
- Master flag: `LLM_COUNCIL_PERFORMANCE_SELECTION` (default **false**).
- Emit `L2_PERFORMANCE_SELECTION_APPLIED` LayerEvent whenever blending
  changes the selected set vs. static-only (auditable route receipt).

### Phase 2 — Early consensus termination (ADR-040 Option F)

In `stage2_collect_rankings`, when the Borda margin of the leader is
**mathematically unassailable** given the reviewers still outstanding
(worst-case remaining votes cannot change the top ranking), cancel the
outstanding reviewer calls and proceed to Stage 3.

- Flag: `LLM_COUNCIL_EARLY_CONSENSUS` (default **false**).
- Never cancels a call already in flight past its first token where the
  gateway cannot cancel cleanly; cancellation is cooperative (asyncio).
- Emits `L3_EARLY_CONSENSUS_TERMINATION` with votes-saved + est. cost saved
  (from ADR-011 per-model history).
- Shadow mode first: when the flag is off, still *detect and log* the
  would-have-terminated point so savings are measurable before enabling.

### Phase 3 — Graduated deliberation depth (cascade)

Extend the ADR-020 Tier-1 confidence-gated fast path from binary
(single model vs. full council) to graduated depth:

- Depth ladder: `single → mini-council (2–3) → full council`.
- Escalation signal: Consensus Strength Score (ADR-036 CSS) + verdict
  confidence from the shallower pass; low consensus ⇒ escalate one rung,
  reusing the already-collected responses as Stage-1 members of the deeper
  pass (no wasted spend).
- Budget integration: the ADR-011 estimator prices each rung; the opt-in
  `BudgetEnforcer` can veto an escalation (auditable WARN/REJECT, never a
  silent downgrade).
- Flag: `LLM_COUNCIL_GRADUATED_DEPTH` (default **false**).
- Escalations emit the existing `L2_DELIBERATION_ESCALATION` event.

### ADR housekeeping

Mark ADR-039 and ADR-043 **Superseded by ADR-044**; ADR-040 Options E/F and
ADR-026 Phase 3 notes updated to point here.

## Consequences

**Positive**
- Activates two epics of dormant telemetry into the largest available
  cost/quality lever (field evidence: 30–85% spend reduction from routing and
  adaptive depth), while quality is protected by confidence-tiered blending
  and consensus-gated escalation.
- Kills two stale draft ADRs and completes two deferred ones with a single
  coherent mechanism, all in-house and offline-capable.
- Route receipts (LayerEvents) make every routing influence auditable.

**Negative / risks**
- Feedback loops: selection favouring historically-good models starves
  challengers of samples → mitigated by the existing anti-herding penalty
  (`apply_anti_herding_penalty`), the audition/graduation pipeline
  (ADR-027/029) as the sanctioned entry path, and capped blend weight (≤0.8).
- Early termination could suppress dissent → it only fires on *mathematical*
  unassailability of the ranking, never on score similarity; dissent
  extraction (ADR-025b) still runs on collected reviews.
- Miscalibrated history misroutes → all phases default OFF; shadow-mode
  logging precedes enablement; blending is bounded, never a replacement.

## Definition of Done (per phase)

Code + tests (cold-start, flag-off no-op byte-identical, event emission,
cancellation safety); user docs (CLAUDE.md env index + module map, README,
CHANGELOG); LLM-facing text where surfaced; flag defaults documented
(everything off). A phase that changes flag-off behaviour fails DoD.

## Compliance / Validation

- Grep-able invariant: outside `metadata/selection.py` blending, the budget
  enforcer, and the graduated-depth escalator, no L1/L2 code reads the
  performance tracker or cost history.
- Flag-off test suite proves byte-identical selection to pre-ADR-044.
- Shadow-mode metrics (would-have-saved) recorded before any default flips.

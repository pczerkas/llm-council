"""Thin eval-framework bridges (ADR-048 P3 / ADR-036 P3 commitment, #420).

External eval suites drive the council as a TARGET through two adapters —
deliberately dependency-free (no deepeval/ragas imports here; the examples
under ``examples/eval_bridges/`` show framework-side wiring):

- ``make_council_eval_callable`` — an async ``prompt -> answer`` callable,
  the shape DeepEval-style harnesses use to generate ``actual_output``.
- ``council_to_ragas_row`` — maps one deliberation onto the RAGAS dataset
  row shape: the chairman synthesis is the ``answer`` and the stage-1
  drafts serve as ``contexts`` (the material the synthesis drew from).

"""Quality-per-dollar configuration matrix (ADR-048 P2, #419).

Runs the same golden dataset across configurations — each council member
solo, the full council, and (flag-on) ADR-044 graduated depth — and renders
the empirical answer to "when does deliberation pay?" using ADR-011 actual
costs. Methodology and caveats: ``bench/METHODOLOGY.md``.

Scoring note: solo configurations produce no council consensus, so envelope
``min_score`` floors are skipped for ``kind="solo"`` (documented in the
methodology); key-content assertions apply to every configuration equally.

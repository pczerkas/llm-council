"""Golden-dataset drift regression harness (ADR-048 P1, #418).

Runs the versioned dataset (``bench/dataset/vN/``) against a configured
council, checks each result against its expected-quality envelope, and
compares aggregates to a committed baseline snapshot.

Cost discipline (ADR-048 council feedback — every run spends real money):
- hard per-run cap ``LLM_COUNCIL_BENCH_MAX_USD`` (default $2.00): checked
  against ACTUALS after every item; the run aborts gracefully at the cap
  with partial results marked partial (exit 2)
- month-to-date guard ``LLM_COUNCIL_BENCH_MONTHLY_USD`` (default $30):
  summed from run artefacts under ``.council/bench/runs/``; a run is
  refused before it starts when the month's spend already exceeds it
- runs are on-demand / scheduled only, NEVER per-PR

Exit codes: 0 within envelope, 1 drift beyond envelope, 2 aborted/partial.

    Without this, two concurrent ``bench run`` invocations (separate

    guard, then both write — jointly exceeding
    ``LLM_COUNCIL_BENCH_MONTHLY_USD`` (a time-of-check-to-time-of-use race).
    Concurrent bench runs aren't the documented usage ("on-demand or nightly,
    never per-PR"), so full mutual exclusion for the run's duration is an
    acceptable, simple fix rather than a partial/periodic re-check. Unix-only
    (fcntl); a no-op on Windows, matching the existing precedent in
    triage/rollback_metrics.py.

    ASYNC on purpose (round 6 review): ``fcntl.flock`` is a blocking syscall
    held across the ``await``s inside the guarded section. A plain
    synchronous acquire would, on contention, block the WHOLE event loop —
    not just the calling coroutine — freezing every other task in the
    process for as long as the lock is held (potentially minutes). No
    current call site runs two ``run_bench`` coroutines concurrently in one
    process (``bench matrix`` awaits them sequentially), so this cannot fire
    today, but the failure mode (a full event-loop freeze, not a clean
    queued wait) is bad enough to close categorically rather than leave as a
    footgun for a future concurrent caller. ``asyncio.to_thread`` moves the
    blocking acquire off the event loop thread so a contended lock merely
    suspends the awaiting coroutine.

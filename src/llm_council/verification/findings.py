"""Structured findings channel (ADR-051) — flag + (later) parser/policy.

C1 (#485) adds only the opt-in flag; C2 adds the chairman findings parser and
C3 the deterministic verdict policy (`policy(findings)`). The whole epic is
gated on ``LLM_COUNCIL_STRUCTURED_FINDINGS`` (default OFF) so it is additive and
non-breaking until a later deliberate default-ON flip (a breaking release).

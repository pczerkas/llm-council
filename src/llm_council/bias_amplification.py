"""Reviewer-agreement decomposition — bias-amplification check (ADR-047 P4, #416).

2026 judge research warns that multi-agent judges can AMPLIFY rather than
cancel shared bias: reviewers agreeing strongly is evidence of quality only
if their consensus does not simply track a shared confound. This module
decomposes agreement per session over the existing ADR-015/018 bias store:

- ``agreement_index`` — how much of the score variance is between models
  rather than between reviewers (ICC-flavoured; 1.0 = perfect convergence).
- ``position_alignment`` — Pearson correlation between each model's consensus
  score and its (negated) display position; high values mean the agreed
  ranking follows presentation order.
- ``amplification_suspect`` — high agreement AND high position alignment:
  the council converged, but along the position confound.

STRICTLY REPORT-ONLY (ADR-047 §P4): pure functions, no writes, no gating
side-effects. Same caveats as ADR-015: with 3–5 models per session these are
anomaly indicators, not significance tests.

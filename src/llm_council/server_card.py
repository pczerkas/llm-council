"""MCP Server Card generation (ADR-045 Phase 2, #405).

Builds a Server Card per SEP-2127 (the `experimental-ext-server-card`
extension tracked for the MCP 2026-07-28 spec cycle): identity, repository,
and docs links, with council-specific metadata (tools, tiers) under a
namespaced ``_meta`` key — SEP-2127 cards intentionally exclude top-level
primitive listings, so vendor data belongs in ``_meta`` only.

The card is **generated from code** (the live FastMCP tool registry), never
hand-maintained, so it cannot drift from the actual server surface. It is
served by the HTTP server at both discovery paths (``/server-card`` per the
extension's recommendation and ``/.well-known/mcp/server-card.json`` per
SEP-1649) and committed as a static ``server-card.json`` for registry
submission (drift-tested against the generator).

RE-CHECK after 2026-07-28: the schema referenced below is the RC shape from
``modelcontextprotocol/experimental-ext-server-card``; if Server Cards
graduate with the final spec, re-vendor the schema, re-validate, and update
``SERVER_CARD_SCHEMA_URL`` if the hosted URL changes.

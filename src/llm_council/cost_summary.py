"""Human/LLM-facing cost + token summary formatting (ADR-011 Phase 1).

Progressive disclosure: ``format_cost_summary`` returns a single dense line by
default (safe for a calling LLM's context window) and the full per-model /
per-stage breakdown only when ``include_details=True``. It consumes the
``metadata["usage"]`` structure produced by ``council._build_usage_summary``.

"""Opt-in PostHog LLM Analytics emitter foundation (ADR-050 Part 5 + transport).

Off by default: with no ``POSTHOG_API_KEY`` the emitter is disabled and every
entry point is a no-op — byte-identical to pre-ADR-050 behavior, and the
optional ``posthog`` SDK is never imported. Emission is **soft-fail**: any
failure (missing SDK, bad key, network down) is logged at debug and never
raises into or delays a verification (ADR-011/024 convention).

This module is only the foundation (config + transport). The actual
``$ai_generation`` property mapping lands in ADR-050 D2 (#474).

"""Per-gateway cost resolution (ADR-011 Phase 1).

Cost fidelity differs by gateway, so a single resolver applies the right
strategy and stamps a ``cost_source`` provenance tag onto each call — a
computed estimate is never presented as a bill:

- OpenRouter / Requesty return an authoritative ``usage.cost`` -> "provider"
- Direct APIs (Anthropic/OpenAI/Google) return tokens only, so cost is
  estimated from the bundled ``models/registry.yaml`` pricing -> "registry_estimate"
- Ollama is local/self-hosted -> "local_zero"
- pricing unknown and no provider figure -> (None, None)

The resolver takes ``pricing_lookup`` by dependency injection (a callable
``model_id -> {"prompt": float, "completion": float}`` per-1K-token dict, the
shape returned by ``MetadataProvider.get_pricing``) so it is unit-testable
without loading the metadata stack. See ADR-011 §1 and ADR-023 §5.
